## SCENARIO 1: No New Games Added

**Competition ends Feb 17 (1 week later)**

### Dex-Morgan grinds hard:
- Gains: 5,000 StatusXP
- End StatusXP: 64,161
- **Score: 5,000 / 74,087 = 6.75%**

### X_imThumper_X casual play:
- Gains: 2,000 StatusXP  
- End StatusXP: 199,673
- **Score: 2,000 / 202,327 = 0.99%**

**WINNER: Dex-Morgan (6.75% vs 0.99%)**

---

## SCENARIO 2: Dex-Morgan Adds 50 New Games Mid-Competition

**Dex-Morgan buys 50 new games on Feb 14:**
- New games potential: 25,000 StatusXP (avg 500 per game)
- Current potential in leaderboard: 158,248 (133,248 + 25,000)
- **Competition locked remaining: STILL 74,087** ✅

### Dex-Morgan grinds all week:
- Gains: 5,000 StatusXP (some from new games, some from old)
- End StatusXP: 64,161
- **Score: 5,000 / 74,087 = 6.75%** (UNCHANGED!)

### X_imThumper_X same casual play:
- Gains: 2,000 StatusXP
- End StatusXP: 199,673
- **Score: 2,000 / 202,327 = 0.99%**

**WINNER: Dex-Morgan (6.75% vs 0.99%)**

---

## SCENARIO 3: What if we DON'T lock potential? (UNFAIR)

**Dex-Morgan with new games:**
- Gains: 5,000 StatusXP
- New remaining: 99,087 (74,087 + 25,000 from new games)
- **UNFAIR Score: 5,000 / 99,087 = 5.05%** ❌ (Penalized for buying games!)

**X_imThumper_X:**
- **Score: 0.99%**

**WINNER: Still Dex-Morgan, but score artificially lowered**

---

## KEY INSIGHT:

✅ **Locking potential** means:
- You CAN earn points from new games (counts toward numerator)
- Your denominator STAYS THE SAME (doesn't dilute your score)
- Fair competition based on effort, not library expansion

❌ **Without locking:**
- Adding games HURTS your score (bigger denominator)
- Punishes players who expand their library
- Creates perverse incentive to NOT buy new games during competition
