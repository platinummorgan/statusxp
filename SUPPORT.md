A: Try these steps:
1. Force close the app completely
2. Clear app cache (Android: Settings → Apps → StatusXP → Clear Cache)
3. Restart your device
4. Reinstall the app if issues persist

A: Stats are calculated from your synced data. If something looks wrong:
1. Force a fresh sync on all platforms
2. Check that all your accounts are connected
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for calculations to complete
4. Contact support if issues persist with specific numbers

**Q: I can't sign in with Google/Apple.**

A: Ensure:
- You're using the latest app version
- Your device date/time is correct
- You have a stable internet connection
- Google Play Services (Android) is up to date

**Q: Status Posters won't generate.**

A: Status Posters require:
- At least one connected platform with synced data

- Latest app version

If it still fails, try force-closing and reopening the app.

**Q: Leaderboards aren't showing my rank.**

A: Leaderboards update every few hours. After your first sync, it may take up to 24 hours to appear. Make sure at least one platform is connected and synced.

### Platform-Specific Issues

**PlayStation (PSN)**

**Q: "Authentication failed" when connecting PSN.**

A: This usually means:
- Incorrect PSN credentials
- Two-factor authentication is enabled (use app-specific password)
- PSN servers are down (check status.playstation.com)

**Q: Hidden trophies aren't showing.**

A: Hidden trophies display once unlocked. For locked hidden trophies, we show the trophy name but keep the description hidden per Sony's policies.

**Xbox**

**Q: "Unable to connect" error with Xbox.**

A: Ensure:
- You're using your Microsoft account email (not gamertag)
- Your Xbox profile is set to "Everyone" in privacy settings
- You're connected to the internet

**Q: Some Xbox achievements are showing as locked when I've earned them.**

A: Xbox achievement sync can have delays. Force a sync and wait 10-15 minutes for the API to update.

**Steam**

**Q: "403 Forbidden" errors during Steam sync.**

A: This means your Steam profile privacy settings are blocking access. To fix:
1. Go to your Steam profile
2. Click "Edit Profile" → "Privacy Settings"
3. Set "Game details" to **Public** (not Friends Only or Private)
4. Also set "My profile" to **Public**
5. Re-run the sync in StatusXP
6. After sync completes, you can change your privacy settings back if desired

**Q: "Invalid Steam ID" error.**

A: You can use either:
- Your numeric Steam ID (found in profile URL: `/profiles/[STEAMID]`)
- Your custom URL (found in profile URL: `/id/[CUSTOMURL]`)

Make sure your Steam profile is set to Public, not Friends Only or Private.

**Q: What do I enter for "Domain Name" when getting a Steam API key?**

A: The "Domain Name" field on steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey is just a label - you can enter anything you want (e.g., "StatusXP", "MyApp", or even "localhost"). It doesn't affect functionality and is only for your reference.

**Q: Steam games missing.**

A: Only games with achievements are shown. Free weekends and deleted games may not appear.
